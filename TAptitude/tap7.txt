A) Recall historical facts
B) Solve novel problems and recognize patterns
C) Use a large vocabulary
D) Apply learned rules to familiar situations
Answer: B) Solve novel problems and recognize patterns

88. A student from a low socioeconomic status (SES) background may face challenges in school due to:
A) Lower innate intelligence
B) Lack of parental interest
C) Limited access to resources like books and educational experiences
D) Inability to learn complex concepts
Answer: C) Limited access to resources like books and educational experiences
Explanation: The primary challenge associated with low SES is often a lack of access to resources (nutrition, healthcare, books, educational toys, enrichment activities) that support learning, not a lack of cognitive potential.
89. The "Project Method" of teaching, advocated by Kilpatrick, emphasizes:
A) Rote memorization
B) Teacher-centered lectures
C) Learning by doing through purposeful activities
D) Standardized testing
Answer: C) Learning by doing through purposeful activities

B) Use the caregiver as a safe base to explore the environment
C) Ignore the caregiver upon reunion after a separation
D) Show intense fear of strangers at all times

91. In Gardner's theory, a chef, a sculptor, or a surgeon would likely have high ________ intelligence.
A) Linguistic
B) Logical-Mathematical
C) Bodily-Kinesthetic
D) Interpersonal
Answer: C) Bodily-Kinesthetic
Explanation: Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence is the potential of using one's whole body or parts of the body to solve problems or create products, as seen in athletes, dancers, and surgeons.
92. The concept of "Negative Reinforcement" involves:
A) Presenting an aversive stimulus to decrease a behavior
B) Removing an aversive stimulus to increase a behavior
C) Removing a pleasant stimulus to decrease a behavior
D) Presenting a pleasant stimulus to increase a behavior
Answer: B) Removing an aversive stimulus to increase a behavior
Explanation: Negative reinforcement strengthens a behavior by taking away something unpleasant. For example, fastening your seatbelt to stop the annoying beep in the car.
93. A student who is an "English Language Learner" should be provided with instruction that includes:
A) Only written texts in English
B) Sheltered instruction with visual aids and contextual support
C) Instruction only in their native language
D) No modifications to the regular curriculum
Answer: B) Sheltered instruction with visual aids and contextual support
Explanation: Sheltered instruction (like the SIOP model) makes academic content comprehensible for ELLs while promoting English language development, using strategies like visuals, gestures, and cooperative learning.
94. According to Piaget, the ability to mentally reverse an action is called:
A) Conservation
B) Seriation
C) Reversibility
D) Decentration
Answer: C) Reversibility
Explanation: Reversibility is the understanding that actions can be reversed. For example, knowing that if 3+5=8, then 8-5 must equal 3. This is a key operation in the concrete operational stage.
95. A teacher who believes that students construct their own understanding through experiences is following the ________ philosophy.
A) Behaviorist
B) Constructivist
C) Essentialist
D) Perennialist
Answer: B) Constructivist
Explanation: Constructivism, heavily influenced by Piaget and Vygotsky, posits that learners actively construct or make their own knowledge and that reality is determined by the experiences of the learner.
96. "Learned Helplessness" in an academic context can be reduced by:
A) Giving constant praise regardless of performance
B) Providing tasks that guarantee success to build a sense of mastery
C) Avoiding all challenging tasks

B) Provide a single, fixed method of instruction for all
C) Offer multiple means of engagement, representation, and action/expression
D) Focus exclusively on academic content
Answer: C) Offer multiple means of engagement, representation, and action/expression

Its core principle is providing multiple ways to engage with material, multiple representations of information, and multiple ways for students to express what they know.
100. The "Strange Situation" procedure is a classic experiment used to assess:
A) Cognitive development
B) Moral reasoning
C) Attachment patterns in infants
D) Language acquisition
Answer: C) Attachment patterns in infants
Explanation: Developed by Mary Ainsworth, the Strange Situation is a structured observational procedure that reveals the quality of an infant's attachment to their caregiver by observing the infant's response to brief separations from and reunions with the caregiver.
