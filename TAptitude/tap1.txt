d) Passive listening
Answer: b) Making meaningful connections to existing knowledge
Explanation: Elaborative rehearsal processes information deeply by connecting new information to existing knowledge, improving long-term retention.
91.	The self-fulfilling prophecy in education is also called: (KVS 2021)
a) Halo effect
b) Pygmalion effect
c) Primacy effect
d) Recency effect
Answer: b) Pygmalion effect
Explanation: The Pygmalion effect shows that teacher expectations can influence student performance, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.
92.	Fluid intelligence involves: (DSSSB 2018)
a) Accumulated knowledge
b) Ability to solve new problems
c) Vocabulary skills
d) Memorized facts
Answer: b) Ability to solve new problems
Explanation: Fluid intelligence is the capacity to think logically and solve novel problems independent of acquired knowledge.
93.	The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon relates to: (REET 2020)
a) Encoding failure
b) Retrieval failure
c) Storage failure
d) Sensory failure
Answer: b) Retrieval failure
Explanation: The tip-of-the-tongue state occurs when you know information is stored but temporarily cannot retrieve it.
94.	Shaping in behavior modification involves: (UGC NET 2020)
a) Reinforcing successive approximations toward a target behavior
b) Punishing unwanted behavior
c) Ignoring all behaviors
d) Random reinforcement
Answer: a) Reinforcing successive approximations toward a target behavior
Explanation: Shaping gradually builds complex behaviors by reinforcing small steps that progressively approach the desired final behavior.
95.	The generation effect suggests that: (CTET 2020)
a) Information generated by oneself is better remembered
b) Older generations learn better
c) New generations are smarter
d) Memory declines with age
Answer: a) Information generated by oneself is better remembered
Explanation: The generation effect shows that information is better retained when learners actively generate it rather than passively receive it.
96.	Latent learning was demonstrated by: (TET 2019)
a) Edward Tolman
b) B.F. Skinner
c) Ivan Pavlov
d) John Watson
Answer: a) Edward Tolman
Explanation: Edward Tolman's experiments showed that learning can occur without reinforcement and remain latent until needed.
97.	The phonological loop is part of: (NTA NET 2021)
a) Long-term memory
b) Working memory
c) Sensory memory
d) Procedural memory
Answer: b) Working memory
Explanation: The phonological loop is a component of working memory that handles verbal and acoustic information.
98.	Extinction in classical conditioning occurs when: (UPTET 2019)
a) Conditioned stimulus is repeatedly presented without unconditioned stimulus
b) Punishment is applied
c) Reinforcement increases
d) New learning begins
Answer: a) Conditioned stimulus is repeatedly presented without unconditioned stimulus
Explanation: Extinction happens when the conditioned stimulus is repeatedly presented without the unconditioned stimulus, weakening the response.
99.	The levels of processing theory was proposed by: (DSSSB 2021)
a) Craik and Lockhart
b) Atkinson and Shiffrin
c) Baddeley and Hitch
d) Miller and Johnson
Answer: a) Craik and Lockhart
Explanation: Craik and Lockhart proposed that memory depends on depth of processing, with deeper semantic processing leading to better retention.
100.	Attribution theory in education focuses on: (REET 2018)
a) How students explain their successes and failures
b) Teacher attributes
c) School characteristics
d) Curriculum features
Answer: a) How students explain their successes and failures
Explanation: Attribution theory examines how students' explanations for their performance (ability, effort, luck, task difficulty) affect motivation and future performance.
