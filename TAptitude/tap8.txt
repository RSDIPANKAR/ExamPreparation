A. Continue lecturing without interruption
B. Pause periodically to ask questions and use quick response techniques (e.g., thumbs up/down)
C. Wait until the final exam
D. Assign a long-term project
Answer: B
Explanation: Formative assessment during a lecture is crucial for checking understanding. Pausing for questioning or using simple, quick feedback mechanisms allows the teacher to gauge comprehension and adjust instruction if needed.
80. Which method is most effective for teaching abstract concepts like "justice" or "democracy"?
A. Drill and practice
B. Demonstration
C. Socratic method and structured debate
D. Memorization of definitions
Answer: C
Explanation: Abstract concepts are best understood through exploration, dialogue, and the examination of different arguments and perspectives. The Socratic method and debate force students to think critically about the meaning and application of such ideas.
81. The "learning station" or "learning center" approach is a form of:
A. Whole-class lecture
B. Individualized and small group work
C. Standardized testing
D. Team teaching
Answer: B
Explanation: In a learning station model, the classroom is set up with several different stations, each with a different task. Students can work individually or in small groups, rotating through the stations at their own pace or on a schedule.
82. When a teacher uses a real object (like a leaf, a rock, or a historical artifact) to teach a concept, they are using a:
A. Textbook
B. Realia
C. Worksheet
D. Video
Answer: B
Explanation: Realia is the term for real-world objects that are brought into the classroom to make learning more concrete, authentic, and multi-sensory.
83. The method that involves a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem is often called:
A. The Algorithmic method
B. The Heuristic method
C. The Socratic method
D. The Lecture method
Answer: A
Explanation: An algorithm is a precise set of rules or steps that guarantees a solution if followed correctly. This method is common in mathematics and computer science for solving well-defined problems.
84. Which method would be most appropriate for teaching a lesson on empathy?
A. Lecture on the definition of empathy
B. Role-playing different social scenarios
C. Drill and practice on empathy-related vocabulary
D. Reading a textbook chapter alone
Answer: B
Explanation: Empathy is an affective skill that is best learned through experience. Role-playing allows students to "walk in someone else's shoes," fostering a deeper emotional understanding than a simple lecture could.
85. A teacher who provides students with a checklist for a good essay and then has them use it to evaluate a sample essay is using a form of:
A. Direct Instruction
B. Peer assessment
C. Lecture
D. Drill
Answer: B
Explanation: Peer assessment involves students evaluating the work of their classmates against a set of criteria. This helps students better understand the expectations for their own work and learn from giving and receiving feedback.
86. The main purpose of using simulations in teaching is to:
A. Replace real-world experience entirely
B. Provide a simplified, safe, and controlled model of a real-world process or system
C. Make students memorize facts
D. Save the teacher time
Answer: B
Explanation: Simulations (like a flight simulator or a model UN) allow students to experience complex, dynamic, or dangerous situations in a safe, controlled environment. They can manipulate variables and see consequences without real-world risk.
87. Which method is best described as "guided discovery"?
A. The teacher tells students everything.
B. The teacher provides materials and asks probing questions to help students discover a concept.
C. Students are left completely alone to figure things out.
D. The teacher demonstrates and students copy exactly.
Answer: B
Explanation: Guided discovery strikes a balance between pure lecture and pure discovery. The teacher doesn't give the answer but actively guides the student's thinking process through strategic questioning and hints.
88. A teacher's decision to use a group discussion rather than a lecture is influenced by their:
A. Educational philosophy (e.g., progressivism vs. essentialism)
B. Height
C. Favorite color
D. Commute time
Answer: A
Explanation: A teacher's underlying philosophy of education heavily influences their choice of methods. A progressive educator, who values student experience and democracy, is more likely to choose discussion, while an essentialist might favor a lecture to transmit core knowledge.
89. Which method focuses on the systematic development of logical thought through the study of formal structures like grammar and logic?
A. The project method
B. The didactic method (in its classical sense)
C. The laboratory method
D. The field trip method
Answer: B
Explanation: The term "didactic" often refers to teacher-centered instruction. In its classical form, it was associated with a highly structured, systematic approach to developing the mind through the study of disciplines like logic and rhetoric.
90. A key feature of the "Mastery Learning" model is:
A. Moving on to new topics regardless of student understanding
B. Students must demonstrate mastery of a topic (e.g., 80% proficiency) before moving to the next one
C. All students learn at the same pace
D. It is only used for art and music
Answer: B
Explanation: Mastery Learning, developed by Benjamin Bloom, is based on the idea that all students can learn if given enough time and appropriate instruction. Students are not allowed to progress until they have mastered the current learning objective.
91. Which teaching method is most closely associated with the behaviorist theory of learning?
A. Inquiry-based learning
B. Socratic method
C. Drill and practice
D. Constructivist approach
Answer: C
Explanation: Behaviorism focuses on observable behaviors shaped by reinforcement. Drill and practice, which involves repetition and immediate feedback (reinforcement), is a direct application of behaviorist principles.
92. The "gallery walk" technique is a classroom activity where students:
A. Walk through an art gallery
B. Move around the classroom in small groups to respond to questions or prompts posted on charts
C. Walk single file to the cafeteria
D. Present their work to the teacher one by one
Answer: B
Explanation: A gallery walk is a kinesthetic and cooperative learning activity. Different questions or tasks are posted on chart paper around the room, and small groups circulate, adding their ideas and building on the work of previous groups.
93. A teacher who ends a lesson by asking students to write down one thing they learned and one question they still have is using:
A. The lecture method
B. An exit ticket (a formative assessment tool)
C. The drill method
D. A homework assignment
Answer: B
Explanation: An exit ticket is a quick, low-stakes formative assessment tool used at the end of a lesson. It provides the teacher with valuable, immediate feedback on student understanding and confusion.
94. Which method is most effective for teaching the interconnections between different subjects (e.g., history, art, and science)?
A. Subject-specific lecture
B. Thematic teaching or interdisciplinary approach
C. Drill and practice on isolated facts
D. A single-subject textbook
Answer: B
Explanation: Thematic or interdisciplinary teaching organizes curriculum around broad themes or concepts. This allows students to see how knowledge from different disciplines connects and relates to a central idea, breaking down subject silos.
95. The primary advantage of using a variety of media (text, audio, video, animations) in teaching is that it:
A. Is always entertaining for students
B. Caters to diverse learning styles and increases engagement
C. Replaces the need for a teacher
D. Is cheaper than traditional methods
Answer: B
Explanation: A multi-media or multi-modal approach recognizes that students learn in different ways. By appealing to multiple senses (visual, auditory, kinesthetic), it can make learning more accessible, engaging, and effective for a wider range of students.
96. In which method does the teacher act as a "delegator"?
A. Lecture
B. Direct Instruction
C. Independent study or project-based learning
D. Drill
Answer: C
Explanation: The delegator style is one of the teacher's roles. In methods like independent study or PBL, the teacher delegates a great deal of responsibility for learning to the students, acting as a resource or consultant rather than a direct instructor.
97. The method that involves students creating a physical or digital representation of their knowledge is called:
A. Note-taking
B. Memorization
C. Modeling or constructionism
D. Listening
Answer: C
Explanation: Constructionism (Papert) is a learning theory that suggests people learn best when they build an external artifact. This could be a robot, a poem, a computer program, or a diorama—a tangible product of their learning.
98. A teacher who consistently uses the same method for every lesson, regardless of the topic or students, is failing to:
A. Be efficient
B. Align methods with objectives and learners
C. Follow the curriculum
D. Use technology
Answer: B
Explanation: Effective pedagogy requires flexibility. The choice of teaching method should be a deliberate decision based on the learning objectives, the nature of the content, and the characteristics of the students.
99. Which method is most effective for helping students retain information over the long term?
A. Cramming and memorization
B. Passive listening to a lecture
C. Active engagement through methods like teaching others or applying knowledge (PBL)
D. Reading a textbook once
Answer: C
Explanation: The "learning pyramid" and cognitive science research show that active involvement leads to much higher retention rates. When students have to apply, analyze, or teach a concept, the learning is much deeper and more durable.
100. A teacher's choice of method should be a "strategic decision." This means the choice should be based on:
A. What is easiest for the teacher
B. What is most popular at the moment
C. A careful analysis of the learning goals, the students, and the context
D. What the teacher's own teachers did
Answer: C
Explanation: A strategic decision is a planned, reasoned choice. The best teachers don't use methods randomly or out of habit; they select the most appropriate tool for the specific job, considering all relevant factors to maximize student learning.
